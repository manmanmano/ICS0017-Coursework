# ICS0017-Coursework
This repository contains the full coursework from the course ICS0017 C/C++ programming at Taltech.
The coursework is divided in two: coursework 1 (C) and coursework 2 (C++).
  - In the first coursework we had to print, insert, and remove from a given datastructure. All the logics is contained in Coursework1.cpp, the other files were given us by the lecturer
  - In the second coursework we had to create the datastructure ourselves and write functions in order to deal this datastructure. Each student of the class was given a different schema. The files I wrote myself are Coursework2.cpp, containing call to main, Datastrcture.h, header file containing class with respective functions, and Functions.cpp, containing all the logics of the functions.
