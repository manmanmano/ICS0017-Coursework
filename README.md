# ICS0017-Coursework
This repository contains the full coursework from the course ICS0017 C/C++ programming at Taltech.
The coursework is divided in two: coursework 1 (C) and coursework 2 (C++).
In the first coursework we had to print, insert, and remove from a given datastructure.
In the second coursework we had to create the datastructure ourselves and write functions in order to deal this datastructure. Each student of the class was given a different schema.
